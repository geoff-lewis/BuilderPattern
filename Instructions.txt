You have been placed in pairs but you can choose to split the work however you feel is best
1) Create a builder for the Company and Employee classes.
2) Implement the unit tests in BuilderPatternTests so they use the builders you have created.
3) Add a Builders file and create the static A and An classes to improve the fluid syntax of your builders in the tests.
4) Optional - Add the implicit operators to the Company and Employee Builder classes and refactor your unit tests to make use of these.
